# Data

[Read](jspmultilevel.md) about our analysis of some data from the Junior
Schools Project.  In addition to a math test, students also
took a test in English. Although it would be possible to analyze the
English test results in the same way that we analyzed the math
scores, additional information may be obtained from analyzing them
simultaneously. Hence we view the data as having a bivariate response
with English and math scores for each student. The student is a
nested factor within the class which is in turn nested within the
school. We express the multivariate response for each individual
by introducing an additional level of nesting at the individual
level. So we might view this as just another nested model except
that there is a fixed subject effect associated with this lowest
level of nesting.

We set up the data in a format with one test score per line
with an indicator `subject` identifying which type of test was
taken. We scale the English and math test scores by their
maximum possible values, 40 and 100, respectively, to aid comparison:


```{r}
data(jsp, package="faraway")
jspr <- jsp[jsp$year==2,]
mjspr <- data.frame(rbind(jspr[,1:6],jspr[,1:6]),
                    subject=factor(rep(c("english","math"),c(953,953))),  
                    score=c(jspr$english/100,jspr$math/40))
```

We can plot the data

```{r jspmplot}
ggplot(mjspr, aes(x=raven, y=score))+geom_jitter(alpha=0.25)+facet_grid(gender ~ subject)
```

# Mixed Effect Model

We now fit a  model for the data that includes
all the variables of interest that incorporates some of
the interactions that we suspect might be present.
See [Extending the Linear Model with R](https://julianfaraway.github.io/faraway/ELM/),

```{r}
mjspr$craven <- mjspr$raven-mean(mjspr$raven)
mmod <- lmer(score ~ subject*gender + craven*subject + social + (1|school) + (1|school:class) + (1|school:class:id),mjspr)
faraway::sumary(mmod)
```

The model being fit for school $i$, class $j$, student $k$ in
subject $l$ is:
$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
  score_{ijkl} =& subject_l + gender_k + raven_k + social_k +
  (subject \times gender)_{lk} +  \\ & (raven \times subject)_{lk} +
  school_i + class_j + student_k + \epsilon_{ijkl}
\end{eqnarray*}
$$
where the Raven score has been mean centered and school, class and
student are random effects with the other terms, apart from $\epsilon$,
being fixed effects.

We can test some fixed effects:

```{r}
mmod <- lmer(score ~ subject*gender+craven*subject+social+  (1|school)+(1|school:class)+(1|school:class:id),mjspr, REML=FALSE)
mmodr <- lmer(score ~ subject*gender+craven+subject+social+(1|school)+(1|school:class)+(1|school:class:id),mjspr, REML=FALSE)
KRmodcomp(mmod, mmodr)
```

We are testing for a subject by gender interaction. We can see that this effect
is strongly statistically  significant.

We can compute confidence intervals for the parameters:

```{r jspmconfint, cache=TRUE}
set.seed(123)
confint(mmod, method="boot", oldNames=FALSE)
```

The lower end of the class confidence interval is zero while the school random effect
is clearly larger. There is some variation associated with individuals.


# INLA

Integrated nested Laplace approximation is a method of Bayesian computation
which uses approximation rather than simulation. More can be found
on this topic in [Bayesian Regression Modeling with INLA](http://julianfaraway.github.io/brinla/) and the 
[chapter on GLMMs](https://julianfaraway.github.io/brinlabook/chaglmm.html)

Use the most recent computational methodology:


```{r}
inla.setOption(inla.mode="experimental")
inla.setOption("short.summary",TRUE)
```

Need to construct unique labels for nested factor levels of class and student:


```{r}
mjspr$school <- factor(mjspr$school)
mjspr$classch <- factor(paste(mjspr$school,mjspr$class,sep="."))
mjspr$classchid <- factor(paste(mjspr$school,mjspr$class,mjspr$id,sep="."))
```

```{r jspminladef, cache=TRUE}
formula <- score ~ subject*gender+craven*subject+social + f(school, model="iid") + f(classch, model="iid") + f(classchid, model="iid")
result <- inla(formula, family="gaussian", data=mjspr)
summary(result)
```

Maybe OK but let's try some more informative priors.


## Informative Gamma priors on the precisions

Now try more informative gamma priors for the precisions. Define it so
the mean value of gamma prior is set to the inverse of the variance of
the residuals of the fixed-effects only model. We expect the error
variances to be lower than this variance so this is an overestimate.
The variance of the gamma prior (for the precision) is controlled by
the `apar` parameter.

```{r jspminlaig,cache=TRUE}
apar <- 0.5
lmod <- lm(score ~ subject*gender+craven*subject+social,mjspr)
bpar <- apar*var(residuals(lmod))
lgprior <- list(prec = list(prior="loggamma", param = c(apar,bpar)))
formula = score ~ subject*gender+craven*subject+social+f(school, model="iid", hyper = lgprior)+f(classch, model="iid", hyper = lgprior)+f(classchid, model="iid", hyper = lgprior)
result <- inla(formula, family="gaussian", data=mjspr)
summary(result)
```

Compute the transforms to an SD scale for the field and error. Make a table of summary statistics for the posteriors:

```{r sumstats}
sigmaschool <- inla.tmarginal(function(x) 1/sqrt(exp(x)),result$internal.marginals.hyperpar[[2]])
sigmaclass <- inla.tmarginal(function(x) 1/sqrt(exp(x)),result$internal.marginals.hyperpar[[3]])
sigmaid <- inla.tmarginal(function(x) 1/sqrt(exp(x)),result$internal.marginals.hyperpar[[4]])
sigmaepsilon <- inla.tmarginal(function(x) 1/sqrt(exp(x)),result$internal.marginals.hyperpar[[1]])
restab=sapply(result$marginals.fixed, function(x) inla.zmarginal(x,silent=TRUE))
restab=cbind(restab, inla.zmarginal(sigmaschool,silent=TRUE))
restab=cbind(restab, inla.zmarginal(sigmaclass,silent=TRUE))
restab=cbind(restab, inla.zmarginal(sigmaid,silent=TRUE))
restab=cbind(restab, inla.zmarginal(sigmaepsilon,silent=TRUE))
colnames(restab) = c(names(lmod$coef),"school","class","id","epsilon")
data.frame(restab)
```

Also construct a plot of the SD posteriors:

```{r plotsdsmjspm}
ddf <- data.frame(rbind(sigmaschool,sigmaclass,sigmaid,sigmaepsilon),
                  errterm=gl(4,nrow(sigmaepsilon),
                             labels = c("school","class","id","epsilon")))
ggplot(ddf, aes(x,y, linetype=errterm, color=errterm))+geom_line()+xlab("score")+ylab("density")+xlim(0,0.15)
```

Posteriors for the school and class assign no weight to values close to zero.

## Penalized Complexity Prior

In [Simpson et al (2015)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4630v3), penalized complexity priors are proposed. This
requires that we specify a scaling for the SDs of the random effects. We use the SD of the residuals
of the fixed effects only model (what might be called the base model in the paper) to provide this scaling.

```{r jspminlapc, cache=TRUE}
lmod <- lm(score ~ subject*gender+craven*subject+social,mjspr)
sdres <- sd(residuals(lmod))
pcprior <- list(prec = list(prior="pc.prec", param = c(3*sdres,0.01)))
formula = score ~ subject*gender+craven*subject+social+f(school, model="iid", hyper = pcprior)+f(classch, model="iid", hyper = pcprior)+f(classchid, model="iid", hyper = pcprior)
result <- inla(formula, family="gaussian", data=mjspr)
summary(result)
```

Compute the summaries as before:

```{r ref.label="sumstats"}
```

Make the plots:


```{r plotsdsmjspmpc}
ddf <- data.frame(rbind(sigmaschool,sigmaclass,sigmaid,sigmaepsilon),
                  errterm=gl(4,nrow(sigmaepsilon),
                             labels = c("school","class","id","epsilon")))
ggplot(ddf, aes(x,y, linetype=errterm, color=errterm))+geom_line()+xlab("score")+ylab("density")+xlim(0,0.15)
```

Class variation is quite small compared to the other sources.

# STAN

[STAN](https://mc-stan.org/) performs Bayesian inference using
MCMC.
Set up STAN to use multiple cores. Set the random number seed for reproducibility.

```{r}
rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE)
options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())
```

Fit the model. Requires use of STAN command file [multiple.stan](../stancode/multiple.stan). We view the code here:

```{r}
writeLines(readLines("../stancode/multiple.stan"))
```

We have used uninformative priors
for the treatment effects but slightly informative half-cauchy priors
for the variances. All the fixed effects have been collected
into a single design matrix.
The school and class variables need to
be renumbered into consecutive positive integers. Somewhat
inconvenient since the schools are numbered up to 50 but have no data
for two schools so only 48 schools are actually used.

```{r}
mjspr$craven <- mjspr$raven-mean(mjspr$raven)
lmod <- lm(score ~ subject*gender+craven*subject+social,mjspr)
sdscal <- sd(residuals(lmod))
Xmatrix <- model.matrix(lmod)
mjspr$school <- factor(mjspr$school)
mjspr$classch <- factor(paste(mjspr$school,mjspr$class,sep="."))
mjspr$classchid <- factor(paste(mjspr$school,mjspr$class,mjspr$id,sep="."))
jspdat <- list(Nobs=nrow(mjspr),
               Npreds=ncol(Xmatrix),
               Nlev1=length(unique(mjspr$school)),
               Nlev2=length(unique(mjspr$classch)),
               Nlev3=length(unique(mjspr$classchid)),
               y=mjspr$score,
               x=Xmatrix,
               levind1=as.numeric(mjspr$school),
               levind2=as.numeric(mjspr$classch),
               levind3=as.numeric(mjspr$classchid),
               sdscal=sdscal)
```

Break the fitting of the model into three steps. We use 5x the default number
of iterations to ensure sufficient sample size for the later estimations.

```{r jspmstancomp, cache=TRUE}
rt <- stanc("../stancode/multiple.stan")
sm <- stan_model(stanc_ret = rt, verbose=FALSE)
set.seed(123)
system.time(fit <- sampling(sm, data=jspdat, iter=10000))
```

## Diagnostics

For the error SD:

```{r jspmstaneps}
pname <- "sigmaeps"
muc <- rstan::extract(fit, pars=pname,  permuted=FALSE, inc_warmup=FALSE)
mdf <- reshape2::melt(muc)
ggplot(mdf,aes(x=iterations,y=value,color=chains)) + geom_line() + ylab(mdf$parameters[1])
```

For the school SD

```{r jspmstansch}
pname <- "sigmalev1"
muc <- rstan::extract(fit, pars=pname,  permuted=FALSE, inc_warmup=FALSE)
mdf <- reshape2::melt(muc)
ggplot(mdf,aes(x=iterations,y=value,color=chains)) + geom_line() + ylab(mdf$parameters[1])
```

For the class SD

```{r jspmstanclass}
pname <- "sigmalev2"
muc <- rstan::extract(fit, pars=pname,  permuted=FALSE, inc_warmup=FALSE)
mdf <- reshape2::melt(muc)
ggplot(mdf,aes(x=iterations,y=value,color=chains)) + geom_line() + ylab(mdf$parameters[1])
```

For the id SD

```{r jspmstanid}
pname <- "sigmalev3"
muc <- rstan::extract(fit, pars=pname,  permuted=FALSE, inc_warmup=FALSE)
mdf <- reshape2::melt(muc)
ggplot(mdf,aes(x=iterations,y=value,color=chains)) + geom_line() + ylab(mdf$parameters[1])
```

All these are satisfactory.

## Output Summary

Examine the main parameters of interest:

```{r}
print(fit,pars=c("beta","sigmalev1","sigmalev2","sigmalev2","sigmaeps"))
```

Remember that the beta correspond to the following parameters:

```{r}
colnames(Xmatrix)
```

The results are comparable to the REML fit. The effective sample sizes are sufficient.

## Posterior Distributions

We can use extract to get at various components of the STAN fit. First consider the SDs for random components:

```{r jspmpdsig}
postsig <- rstan::extract(fit, pars=c("sigmaeps","sigmalev1","sigmalev2","sigmalev3"))
ref <- reshape2::melt(postsig,value.name="score")
ref$L1 = factor(ref$L1)
levels(ref$L1) = c("epsilon","school","class","id")
ggplot(data=ref,aes(x=score, color=L1))+geom_density()+guides(color=guide_legend(title="SD"))
```

As usual the error SD distribution is  more concentrated. The class SD is more diffuse, smaller and gives some weight to values close to zero. Now the treatment effects:


```{r jspmpdbeta}
ref <- reshape2::melt(rstan::extract(fit, pars="beta"))
colnames(ref)[2:3] <- c("parameter","score")
ref$parameter <- factor(colnames(Xmatrix)[ref$parameter])
ggplot(ref, aes(x=score))+geom_density()+geom_vline(xintercept = 0) + facet_wrap(~parameter,scales="free")
```

# BRMS

[BRMS](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/) stands for Bayesian Regression Models with STAN. It provides a convenient wrapper to STAN functionality. We specify the model as in `lmer()` above.
I have used more than the standard number of iterations because this reduces some problems
and does not cost much computationally.


```{r jspmbrmfit, cache=TRUE}
suppressMessages(bmod <- brm(score ~ subject*gender + craven*subject + social + (1|school) + (1|school:class) + (1|school:class:id),data=mjspr,iter=10000, cores=4))
```

We get some minor warnings. We can obtain some posterior densities and diagnostics with:

```{r jspmbrmsdiag}
plot(bmod, variable = "^s", regex=TRUE)
```

We have chosen only the random effect hyperparameters since this is
where problems will appear first. Looks OK. We can see some weight
is given to values of the class effect SD close to zero.

We can look at the STAN code that `brms` used with:

```{r}
stancode(bmod)
```

We see that `brms` is using student t distributions with 3 degrees of
freedom for the priors. For the three error SDs, this will be truncated at
zero to form half-t distributions. You can get a more explicit description
of the priors with `prior_summary(bmod)`. These are qualitatively similar to the
the PC prior used in the INLA fit. 

We examine the fit:

```{r}
summary(bmod)
```

The results are consistent with those seen previously.

# MGCV

It is possible to fit some GLMMs within the GAM framework of the `mgcv`
package. An explanation of this can be found in this 
[blog](https://fromthebottomoftheheap.net/2021/02/02/random-effects-in-gams/)


```{r jspmgam, cache=TRUE}
gmod = gam(score ~ subject*gender + craven*subject + social +
            s(school,bs="re") + 
            s(classch,bs="re") + 
            s(classchid,bs="re"),
            data=mjspr, method="REML")
```

and look at the summary output:

```{r jspmgamsum, cache=TRUE}
summary(gmod)
```

We get the fixed effect estimates.
We also get tests on the random effects (as described in this [article](https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/ast038). The hypothesis of no variation
is rejected for the school and id but not for the class. This is consistent
with earlier findings.

We can get an estimate of the operator and error SD:

```{r}
gam.vcomp(gmod)
```

The point estimates are the same as the REML estimates from `lmer` earlier.
The confidence intervals are different. A bootstrap method was used for
the `lmer` fit whereas `gam` is using an asymptotic approximation resulting
in substantially different results. Given the problems of parameters on
the boundary present in this example, the bootstrap results appear more
trustworthy.

The fixed effect estimates can be found with:

```{r}
coef(gmod)[1:14]
```

The remaining random effects are too numerous to print.

# GINLA

In [Wood (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/asz044), a
simplified version of INLA is proposed. The first
construct the GAM model without fitting and then use
the `ginla()` function to perform the computation.

```{r jspmginlacomp, cache=TRUE}
gmod = gam(score ~ subject*gender + craven*subject + social +
            s(school,bs="re") + 
            s(classch,bs="re") + 
            s(classchid,bs="re"),
            data=mjspr, fit = FALSE)
gimod = ginla(gmod)
```

We get the posterior density for the intercept as:

```{r jspmginlaint}
plot(gimod$beta[1,],gimod$density[1,],type="l",xlab="score",ylab="density")
```

We get the posterior density for the  math effect as:

```{r jspmginlaraven}
plot(gimod$beta[2,],gimod$density[2,],type="l",xlab="score",ylab="density")
```

and for the social effects as:

```{r jspgminlalsoc}
xmat = t(gimod$beta[5:12,])
ymat = t(gimod$density[5:12,])
matplot(xmat, ymat,type="l",xlab="score",ylab="density")
legend("left",paste0("social",2:9),col=1:8,lty=1:8)
```

We can see some overlap between the effects, but strong evidence of a negative outcome
relative to social class 1 for some classes.

It is not straightforward to obtain the posterior densities of
the hyperparameters. 

# Discussion

See the [Discussion of the single random effect model](pulp.md#Discussion) for
general comments. 

- As with the previous analyses, sometimes the INLA posteriors for the hyperparameters have densities
which do not give weight to close-to-zero values where other analyses suggest this might be reasonable.

- There is relatively little disagreement between the methods and much similarity.

- There were no major computational issue with the analyses (in contrast with some of
the other examples)

- The `mgcv` analyses (both standard and ginla) took much longer than previous analyses because the sample size is larger and there are a large number of random effects --- slower than any of the other analyses.
